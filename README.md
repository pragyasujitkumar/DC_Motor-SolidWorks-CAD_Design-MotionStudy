# DC Motor: SolidWorks CAD Model & Motion Study

A 3D **SolidWorks CAD model** of a DC motor with **Motion Study** to visualize its dynamic behavior and mechanical interactions. This project demonstrates how modeling and simulation techniques can bring mechanical designs to life.

---

##  Project Overview

- **SolidWorks Modeling**  
  Designed a detailed DC motor from scratch in SolidWorks covering components like the rotor, stator, housing and auxiliary parts, all accurately assembled.

- **Motion Study Setup**  
  Created a motion study to animate rotational motion and inspect mechanical interactions across the motor components.

### Model Visualization: Change Transparency in SolidWorks

To showcase internal components' working like the rotor rotation more clearly during Motion Study, toggle part transparency in SolidWorks.
